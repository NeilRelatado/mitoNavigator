 <b style="font-size:xx-large">Mitochondrial Disease / Dysfunction and Perserving Mitochondrial Health</b>
<p style="text-align:left">
  &nbsp   &nbsp   &nbsp   &nbsp  The term mitochondrial disease covers a multitude of heterogenous disease that are linked clinically and biochemically. There is a primary genetic disease and secondary mitochondrial disease where there is evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction. These are but not limited 10 neurodegenerative, later-onset diseases like ALS, Alzheimer’s ,Parkinson’s disease, and Type 2 diabetes. There is growing evidence that virtually any disease may have some mitochondrial dysfunction because the mitochondria is so critical to metabolism

<b>The spectrum of mitochondrial disease </b>
<p style="text-align:left">
 &nbsp   &nbsp   &nbsp   &nbsp There is a growing interest in understanding disturbances in mitochondrial metabolism and more common diseases of aging. Per F.D Kendall author of Mitochondrial disorder diagnostic trends published in Mitochondrial disorders: Overview of diagnostic tools and new diagnostic trends, Journal of Pediatric Biochemistry 2 (2012) 193-203

“Mitochondrial disorders have a far larger footprint and impact than was previously  noted with an incidence of at least 1 om 5,000 individuals [1,3-6]. Recent studies have also that 1 in 200 newborns carry one of the ten common mtDNA mutations, perhaps contributing the onset or development of many common place disease…”

        <b>Mitochondrial health </b>
        <p style="text-align:left" >
&nbsp   &nbsp   &nbsp   &nbsp Because evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in neurodegeneration, antioxidants including beta carotene and vitamins C & E have been identified for their oxidative protection in neurodegenerative diseases. Other therapies believed to improve mitochondrial function include creatine, coenzyme Q10, idebenone, and calorie-restricted diets. Beside nutrient support, there is exciting early evidence that exercise may have a role in repairing malfunctioning mitochondria. 
The potential to restore and preserve mitochondrial health holds great promise for treating mitochondrial disease in the future.
