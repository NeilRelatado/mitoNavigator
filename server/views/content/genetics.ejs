            A mother will passs on her mitocondrial DNA malfunction to her children. Each child will be affected with different degrees
            of severity. It is not possible to predict how the children affected, it may not be the same as the mother. This
            makese it stressful for women with mitocondrial disease who what to start a family.

          <b style="font-size:large">Autosomal recessive inheritance</b>
          <p style="text-align:left">
            The mitocondrial DNA is inherited from both parents. The child will get a mutated gene but not the disease if both parents
            are carriers of a mutated gene. This is called autosomal ressive inheritance.
            <br /> When both parents are carriers there is :<br />

            <b style="font-size:medium">a 25% chance of having a child with the disease</b><br />
            <b style="font-size:medium">a 50% chance of having a child who is a carrier like the parents (has the mutation, but not the disease)</b><br
            />
            <b style="font-size:medium">a 25% chance of having a child that is not a carrier and does not have the disease</b></p><br
          />

          <b style="font-size:large">Autosomal dominant inheritance</b>
          <p style="text-align:left">
            If a parent has a dominant nuclear gene mutation, 50% of the the parents children will have an abnormal mitocondrial gene.
            If the other parent has a normal mitocondrial gene,the child will inherit the gene from him or her.
