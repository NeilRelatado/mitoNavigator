        <b style="font-size:xx-large">Mitochondrial Disease / Dysfunction and Perserving Mitochondrial Health</b>
        <p style="text-align:left">
          The term mitochondrial disease covers a multitude of heterogenous disease that are linked clinically and biochemically. There
          is a primary genetic disease and secondary mitochondrial disease where there is evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction.
          These are but not limited 10 neurodegenerative, later-onset diseases like ALS, Alzheimer’s ,Parkinson’s disease,
          and Type 2 diabetes. There is growing evidence that virtually any disease may have some mitochondrial dysfunction
          because the mitochondria is so critical to metabolism

          There is no cure and diagnosis can sometimes take months or years because symptoms often mimic other diseases

          <b>The spectrum of mitochondrial disease </b>
          <p style="text-align:left">
            There is a growing interest in understanding disturbances in mitochondrial metabolism and more common diseases of aging.
            Per F.D Kendall author of Mitochondrial disorder diagnostic trends published in Mitochondrial disorders: Overview
            of diagnostic tools and new diagnostic trends, Journal of Pediatric Biochemistry 2 (2012) 193-203
            <br />
            <br /> “Mitochondrial disorders have a far larger footprint and impact than was previously noted with an incidence
            of at least 1 om 5,000 individuals [1,3-6]. Recent studies have also that 1 in 200 newborns carry one of the
            ten common mtDNA mutations, perhaps contributing the onset or development of many common place disease…”

          <b>Mitochondrial health </b>
          <p style="text-align:left">
            Because evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in neurodegeneration, antioxidants including beta
            carotene and vitamins C & E have been identified for their oxidative protection in neurodegenerative diseases.
            Other therapies believed to improve mitochondrial function include creatine, coenzyme Q10, idebenone, and calorie-restricted
            diets. Beside nutrient support, there is exciting early evidence that exercise may have a role in repairing malfunctioning
            mitochondria. The potential to restore and preserve mitochondrial health holds great promise for treating mitochondrial
            disease in the future.
